# Python for Everybody

I completed this course back in 2018. I was not using github at that time. I started using github in 2021 and I uploaded the course files (example and assigment code) at that time and those files are located <a href='https://github.com/khanahmedm/OnlineCourses/tree/main/Python'>here</a>.

I just recently went through the materials and uploaded them again as they may contain some changes.

Python for Everybody is a great course for beginners and also a good course if you do not use Python regularly and want to refresh your knowlegde. It was prepared by Dr. Charles Severance.
